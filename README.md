# L_Executed
Lookup executed prisoners in the US from https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/ by 
name, 
race, 
age, 
victims (not victim names), 
date of execution, 
state, 
execution method, 
county, 
and other variables.. 

This also tries to find more information about an individual from http://murderpedia.org/, 
but is not always successful in scraping because of my shitty code..

## Notice
This is shit i wrote in English class when the topic was execution (moral dilemmas etc..) 
and I thought it would be cool to just type a name and get all this information with python
without having to go through the bulky website. Also, where applicable, it is great to get additional info 
from murderpedia.org in one go.
